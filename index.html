            <h1>Dr. Julia Lynford</h1>
            <p>I am a New York state licensed clinical psychologist and received my doctorate from Long Island University - Post and my post-doctoral training at a private practice in Westchester and Manhattan. I am well-versed in several approaches to therapy, however, my primary method of working is psychodynamic treatment with a special focus on fostering attachment. I am deeply committed to helping my patients explore and understand their attachment styles and working with them to gain insight as a means for psychological growth and relief.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            As a New York state licensed psychologist, my primary objective is to help my patients find the growth and healing necessary so that they can reach their goals. While I have been trained extensively in multiple therapeutic modalities, I primarily work using a psychodynamic approach, which entails gaining insight into thoughts, feelings, and behaviors by exploring the past, present, and any associations that come to mind. I help my patients make connections and gain insight in order to form new patterns and understanding, leading to reduction in symptoms and improved mental health.
            <br /><br />
            Navigating diversity gracefully can be challenging, however through my training at several diverse institutions, including Jacobi Medical Center, New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and Sagamore Children’s Psychiatric Center, I have worked with people from many cultural backgrounds. It is my goal to help those whom I work with to handle difficult life transitions, moments, and emotions with cultural sensitivity, compassion, and understanding. 
            <br /><br />
            Throughout my training I have worked with varying populations including inpatient settings, outpatient clinics, schools, and substance use programs. While I have trained with patients of all ages, I primarily work now with adults ages 18 and up with a wide variety of clinical concerns including, anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, and trauma.

          <h3>What services are provided?</h3>
          <p>Dr. Lynford provides individual psychotherapy sessions online using doxy.me.</p>
          <h3>What does Dr. Lynford treat?</h3>
          <p>Dr. Lynford’s areas of expertise include depression, anxiety, and trauma. She also treats relationship conflicts, addiction, and issues related to life transitions and adjustments.</p>
          <h3>How long are sessions typically?</h3>
          <p>Sessions are typically 45-minutes. Most patients choose to meet once a week, however, frequency can be discussed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <h3>What is an out-of-network provider?</h3>
          <p>Dr. Lynford is not in-network with any insurance companies, however, superbills (which are statements for insurance reimbursement) can be provided monthly. This means that payment is due monthly for treatment, however, if you have out-of-network benefits through your insurance, you will be eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of the fee. Insurance is confusing! Please reach out to discuss fees and how to get reimbursed for treatment.</p>
